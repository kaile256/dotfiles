! `xmodmap %:p` to test this file.
!
! Note: check keycodes by `xmodmap -pke` or `xcape -d`
! or you will get in /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h (without XK_prefix)

! How to modify [modifier key]:
!   rmove Lock = Caps_Lock <- make "Caps_Lock (keysym)" modifiable
!   keysym = Caps_Lock = Escape Caps_Lock <-
!   add Lock = Caps_Lock <- set modified "Caps_Lock"

! Format:
! keycode {num (xmodmap -pke)} = {keysym}
! remove {modkey (xmodmap -pm)} = {keysym}
! add {modkey (xmodmap -pm)} = {keysym}

! Swap `keycode 51 = backslash bar backslash bar` with `keycode 29 = Caps_Lock`
! (gotten from /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/1386/include/ctrl.map.gz)

! keycode 51 = Caps_Lock
! clear lock
! add lock = Escape
! keycode 66 = Caps_Lock

! Physical Ctrl-key is keycode (number) 37 ; KEYSYMNAME (default Logical code role) is Ctrl_L
! Physical Fn-key is keycode 151 ; default logical code role is XF86WakeUp
!keysym Control_L = XF86WakeUp
!remove Fn_Lock = XF86WakeUp
! Change: Fn key (151) to Ctrl func; S-Fn key to Fn func
!keycode 151 = Control_L XF86WakeUp
!add Control = Control_L
!add XF86WakeUp = Control_L
! Change: Ctrl key to Fn func
!keycode 37 = XF86WakeUp

! Exchange left Alt and left Win
!remove mod1 = Alt_L
!remove mod4 = Super_L
!add mod1 = Super_L
!add mod4 = Alt_L
! Exchange tilde and lesser/greater
!keycode 94 = grave asciitilde dead_grave dead_tilde grave asciitilde
!keycode 49 = less greater less greater bar brokenbar bar brokenbar

! Eisu_toggle by Caps_Lock; Caps_Lock by Shift-Caps_Lock
! Ref: https://wiki.archlinux.jp/index.php/Mozc
! keycode foo = NORMAL SHIFTED
!keycode 66 = Eisu_toggle Caps_Lock
!clear Lock
