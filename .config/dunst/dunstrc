# Display notification on focused monitor.  Possible modes are:
#   mouse: follow mouse pointer
#   keyboard: follow window with keyboard focus
#   none: don't follow anything
#
# "keyboard" needs a windowmanager that exports the

# This should be the case for almost all modern windowmanagers.

# If the width is omitted but the height is given ("-geometry x2"), the message
# window expands over the whole screen (dmenu-like).
# {x}: positive to measure from left; negative from right side of the screen.
# {y}: measure from the top and down as {x}.   In this case the actual width is
# the screen width minus the width defined in within the geometry option.

# Every section that isn't one of the above is interpreted as a rules to
# override settings for certain messages.
# Messages can be matched by "appname", "summary", "body", "icon", "category",
# "msg_urgency" and you can override the "timeout", "urgency", "foreground",
# "background", "new_icon" and "format".
# Shell-like globbing will get expanded.
#
# SCRIPTING
# You can specify a script that gets run when the rule matches by
# setting the "script" option.
# The script will be called as follows:
#   script appname summary body icon urgency
# where urgency can be "LOW", "NORMAL" or "CRITICAL".
#
# NOTE: if you don't want a notification to be displayed, set the format
# to "".
# NOTE: It might be helpful to run dunst -print in a terminal in order
# to find fitting options for rules.
